<p>Language: Telugu.</p>
<h3>Kirik Party</h3>
<p>Again a coming of age film and once again set in an engineering college. Shot with great style and flawless acting by the lead-Rakshit Shetty.</p>

<p>Language: Kannada.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>

<p>A film about the crime that chooses not to be melodramatic, infact it is written and shot in an quirky way. A film that you'll love if you pay close attention to the dialogues.  </p>
