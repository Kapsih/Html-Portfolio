    <h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
<p>I'm a B.Tech Computer Science Graduate from SRM University-AP. I graduated in the year 2022, which means that the final two years of my
  UG were held online. It was a period of confusion and my future seemed uncertain to me. I did what was necessary--submitted my assignments, took all the exams, and graduated. 
  Unfortunatly, what I didn't do -- was apply what I had learnt in my classes.In the beginning of 2023, I started coding again. I'm taking baby steps to rediscover the joy of coding. This project is one such baby step. 
  I hope that, with the skills I develop, I work on projects that have a positive impact on the World.  </p>
